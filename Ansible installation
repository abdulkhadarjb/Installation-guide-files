Ansible installation on linux
===========================================
when lunch instance select amazon linux-2 AMI for ansible easy installation
follow commands

sudo amazon-linux-extars ansible2 -y

yum install ansible >> check ansible version you will get conf and hosts
 
 sudo vi /etc/ansible/hosts >>> give private IP address at which you want to control come out

 sudo vi /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg >>> (uncomment)remove "#" for inventory and sudo_user permissions

 useradd ansible
 passwd ansible
set password same for  all >> this step while do all instance where you practice

 sudo visudo >>> give below root --- ansible AlL=(All) NOPASSWD:AlL

 sudo etc/ssh/sshd_config
below check give password yes
 -------------------------------------------------------------------
 lunch other Ec2-instance for checking ansible code working nodes 
 
 useradd ansible
 passwd ansible
 
 visudo>> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:AlL
 
 vi /etc/ssh/sshd_cfg >>> give password-yes
 try above both commands in your nodes 
 
 after retsart sshd connection in all instance 
 systemctl restart sshd
 systemctl status sshd >> status:running
 
 ======================================
 
 su - ansible >>> in all you lunched instance
 
 ssh-keygen
 ssh-copy-id ansible@locathost(ansible ip address)
 
 ssh-copy-id ansible@localhost (or public id )
 ssh 'ansible@ip address which you added in above commands'
 
 hostname -i >>> you will get node ip adress means it was added 
 type exit
 
 do this 3 steps for ansible instace
 
 ======================================================
 Run this commands in ansible instance > when you want access other instance enter instance public id or group name instead of localhost
 Ahod commands
-----------------
 ansible localhost(node name or group name ) -ba "command" 
 ansible localhost -m copy "src=file path dest=where to paste path"
 
 Module Commands
 ----------------
 ansible localhost -b -m yum -a "pkg=git state=present,latest,version no"
 ansible localhost -b -m service -a "name=git state=started,restarted,absent"


 ansible localhost -b -m user -a "name=abdul"

playbooks write
============================================
only yml files access playbooks so we need write code in yml file system
if you don't know how to write yml check in browser


every playbook start with --- next at end of filename abdul.yml(.yml was mandatory for recognize yml file)

---
- name: install git
  hosts: your server name (menstioned  in ansible/hosts)
  become: true
  tasks:
  - name: install apache2
    yum: 
      name: git
      state: present( you can give your requried version)
